# Rapid Invoice Management System

Rapid Invoice Management system is a fast cloud based invoicing / billing solution. The system enables you to add products and items, create customers and users, and generate as many invoices, receipts and quotes as you want.

The system provides some other awesome features which include instant invoice calculations for items, quantity, discounts, Taxes / VAT and total without any extra effort. I build this app to submit as a minor project in my college.
